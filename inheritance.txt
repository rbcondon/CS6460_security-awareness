TITL: RE: Your Overdue Payment
BODY: <br><h4>Dear Beneficiary,</h4>

<p>
  I hope that this correspondence is received with the <b>urgency and the 
  expediency required</b>. It has come to the notice of the Board of Trustees at 
  the CBN that your present inheritance claims application being handled by the 
  <a href=<MYLINK>> Remitting Bank in Nigeria</a> is experiencing some man made 
  irregularities.
</p>
<p>
  To this effect, it has become necessary for the Board of Trustees to invite 
  trained Fund Transfer / Assets transfer Specialists from the United States to 
  resolve and regularize your fund release with <b>immediate</b> effect and stop all 
  further fund discrepancies. We at Howard & Associates have been duly consulted by the 
  CBN Board of Trustees and have been fully informed about how the staff of the 
  remitting bank have been taking advantage of you by telling you to pay 
  unnecessary exorbitant charges which will only make your fund payment a long 
  drawn out process. Due to this we have decided to step into the process of 
  your fund transfer to enable your funds to be transferred within the soonest 
  possible time without needing to pay all the huge sums of monies that are 
  being demanded from you by the remitting bank, you are to get back to us 
  immediately. All processes to have your funds paid to you immediately through 
  the Federal Reserve Bank in New York have been initiated to cut out 
  unnecessary costs.You are advised to keep this communication highly 
  confidential as the CBN Board of Trustees have asked us to resolve this fund 
  payment independent of the office of the CBN Governor to identify the the 
  principal participants in this unethical payment procedure.Furthermore,you are 
  hereby advised to pay no further fees or charges to the Remitting Bank in 
  Nigeria as well as any person or persons, Real or Fictitious, prostates and 
  institutions as they shall no longer be handling your payment process.
