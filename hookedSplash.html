<p><strong>DON'T FALL FOR THE PHISHING HOOK!</strong><br><img src="https://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phishing.jpg" style="width:300px;height:500px;"><br><br />What is Phishing?!<br /><br>Fake or fraudulent emails specifically designed to take advantage of the<br />recipient. Often phishing attacks try to trick the recipient into divulging sensitive information or<br />contain a method to compromise the victim&rsquo;s computer. This can be done by directing<br />recipients to malicious links or persuading recipients to download malicious attachments. Some<br />phishing emails contain no links or attachments and instead use scare tactics to convince the<br />recipient to send the attacker payments. Over 90% of data breaches begin with a simple<br />phishing attack.

  <br /><br>What should you do if you think you&rsquo;ve experienced phishing?<br /><br>The best thing to do is forward the email to your cybersecurity team before deleting<br />it from your inbox. This gives them a chance to determine if anyone else happened to receive<br />the same email and if action needs to be taken. If you&rsquo;ve clicked through a phishing email and<br />realized it is malicious after it&rsquo;s too late you should immediately tell your cybersecurity team<br />and maybe even reset your password if you submitted credentials. Being embarrassed about<br />falling for a phishing email and not reporting it to anyone is the worst approach you could take<br />in this situation. There is no judgment from the cybersecurity team, their main goal is to keep<br />everyone safe and protect the company from all security incidents</p>
