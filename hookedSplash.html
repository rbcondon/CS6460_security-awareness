<p>Phishing<br />What is Phishing?<br />Fake or fraudulent emails specifically designed to take advantage of the<br />recipient. Often phishing attacks try to trick the recipient into divulging sensitive information or<br />contain a method to compromise the victim&rsquo;s computer. This can be done by directing<br />recipients to malicious links or persuading recipients to download malicious attachments. Some<br />phishing emails contain no links or attachments and instead use scare tactics to convince the<br />recipient to send the attacker payments. Over 90% of data breaches begin with a simple<br />phishing attack.<br />How can you protect yourself from phishing?<br />The best way to protect yourself from phishing is learning the common<br />techniques attackers use in these emails. Keep in mind most legitimate senders will not ask you<br />for sensitive information over email. The following are ways to determine if an email may be<br />malicious in nature:<br />● Generic or impersonal greeting to start the body of the email<br />○ Attackers usually send phishing emails to many recipients which is why the<br />greeting is rarely personal. A targeted phishing email is called spear phishing<br />which will be discussed further down.<br />● Email contains spelling or grammar errors<br />○ Attackers behind phishing emails are often from different countries which will<br />sometimes result in the emails reading as if they were translated from a foreign<br />language to english.<br />● Hover over all links in emails!<br />○ An email link may appear as if it&rsquo;s taking you to a safe URL, but hovering over the<br />link may show a different destination. Attackers like to trick recipients by<br />disguising links.<br />● Enticing or urgent subject<br />The initial goal of an attacker is for you to open their email and not skip over it<br />when viewing your inbox. End users are more likely to open emails with<br />intriguing subjects.<br />● Urgent message in email body<br />○ Once an end user opens an email, the attacker sometimes wants to cause panic<br />while the recipient reads the message. A sense of urgency may cause the end<br />user to perform an action without completely thinking it through.<br />● Images in the email don&rsquo;t load<br />○ Attackers may use fake images to make an email look more official, sometimes<br />these images won&rsquo;t load properly upon delivery.<br />● The sender email is illegitimate, spoofed or unfamiliar<br />○ A sender email can easily be changed to trick a recipient into thinking it is coming<br />from a trusted sender. Sometimes this is as simple as changing the &ldquo;m&rdquo; in<br />Microsoft to a &ldquo;rn&rdquo;, or the attacker may take the extra effort to spoof the sender<br />address which hides the true sender field. If you&rsquo;ve never received an email from<br />the sender before then there&rsquo;s a greater chance of it being suspicious.<br />● Pick up the phone and call the sender<br />○ If an email claims to be from a sender you know on a personal level but it looks<br />suspicious, sometimes it can be easiest to call and ask that person if he or she<br />actually sent you the email.<br />What should you do if you think you&rsquo;ve experienced phishing?<br />If you&rsquo;ve gone through the above checklist and determined an email was<br />malicious, the best thing to do is forward the email to your cybersecurity team before deleting<br />it from your inbox. This gives them a chance to determine if anyone else happened to receive<br />the same email and if action needs to be taken. If you&rsquo;ve clicked through a phishing email and<br />realized it is malicious after it&rsquo;s too late you should immediately tell your cybersecurity team<br />and maybe even reset your password if you submitted credentials. Being embarrassed about<br />falling for a phishing email and not reporting it to anyone is the worst approach you could take<br />in this situation. There is no judgment from the cybersecurity team, their main goal is to keep<br />everyone safe and protect the company from all security incidents</p>
